Touchpad switch for Asus A516J(Linux) 
===============================
Hotkey (Fn + f6 - "enable/disable touchpad") doesn't work for Asus A516J(Xubuntu 20.04 LTS)

touchpad.sh - touchpad on / off script. (must be moved to /usr/bin)

setup.sh - install hotkey. Need to restart after install.

To install (without sudo):

    ./setup.sh
